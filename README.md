# Sigillum-Diaboli
 A 3D game which started as a 2022 new year resolution, with a simple goal: creating a 
 game from scratch using LWJGL and JOML libraries.
 
 The sub-goals to reach this are the following:
 * Creating a 3D environment using modern OpenGL and basic rendering techniques (forward lighting, fog effect, particles).
 * Generate a procedural map for each game session.
 * Support multiplayer by adding communication between a server and multiple clients.
 * Implementing physics and entity movement.
 * Add various gameplay elements to turn it into an actual game.
 * Support for 3D sounds and background music using OpenAL library.
 * (Create an AI for non player characters).
